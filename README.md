# ELEC6242 Cryptography Coursework

My attempt at the coursework for ELEC6242 Cryptography. I studied this module during part IV of MEng Computer Science at the University of Southampton, in the 2020/2021 academic year.

For this coursework we were tasked with decrypting three different ciphers, with no additional information given regarding the method of encryption used to create them. Each student studying the module was given a unique set of ciphers to decrypt. This repository contains the ciphers I was given, the code I wrote to aid me in decrypting them, and my report detailing the process.
